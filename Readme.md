# 🎯 Math Adventures — AI Adaptive Learning System

An **AI-powered adaptive learning game** that dynamically adjusts question difficulty (Easy, Medium, Hard) based on the learner’s accuracy and response time — powered by **Logistic Regression**.

---

## 🚀 Project Overview

**Math Adventures** is an intelligent learning system that tailors the difficulty level of math puzzles (addition, subtraction, multiplication) in real-time using **machine learning predictions**.  

The system:
- Generates synthetic training data representing learning behavior.  
- Trains a **Logistic Regression model** to predict the next difficulty level.  
- Conducts an **interactive math quiz session**, where question difficulty adapts automatically.  
- Displays a **session summary** with accuracy, response time, and recommended next level.
